# typeprint.py

A terrible python script to output the contents of a file as if it were being typed by one of the l33t hack3rs you get in films. I made this because vypr's [typeprint](http://github.com/vypr/typeprint) didn't have an easy way to change the speed of output.

# Usage

```
typeprint.py --ifile <input file> --speed <1 - 5>
```
